# pythonForHacking
simple scripts written in python for hacking.

[+] NOTE:
***FOR SCRIPT 'wifi-disconnect-devices'***
You can also set "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff" (broadcast MAC address ) as addr1 (target_mac) and this will cause a complete denial of service, as no device can connect to that access point, this is quite harmful!
